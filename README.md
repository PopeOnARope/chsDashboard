============

My final project. A social app for tourists and locals to connect to great food, music, and entertainment in America's greatest city.


This project uses angular JS async calls to sync with api's from Bandsintown.com, Factual.com, and openweathermap.org.
It also uses simple inine api calls to google maps and google street view api.
It also makes use of html5's geolocation feature, although this has been temporarily disabled for demonstration purposes. 

To clone:

1. clone this repo

3. run bower install
4. run grunt serve
